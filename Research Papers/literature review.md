# 1. **Knowledge Graph-Based Chatbot With GPT-3 and Neo4j**  
[ðŸ”— Link to article](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/knowledge-graph-based-chatbot-with-gpt-3-and-neo4j/)

---

### **Key Findings**
- **Diffbot API** can be used for NLP pipeline testing:
  - Offers **100k free credits**.
  - **Not suitable for production** (paid and expensive).
- **Custom NER Pipeline** for testing:

# 2. **A Benchmark to Understand the Role of Knowledge Graphs on Large Language Modelâ€™s Accuracy for Question Answering on Enterprise SQL Databases**

---

- **Alignment**: Closely matches our work.
- **Dataset Used**: Enterprise relational database schema in the insurance domain.  
  [ðŸ”— SQL DDL Link](https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/13-04-15.ddl)
- **Application**: Useful during OWL and R2RML phase and benchmarking.

---

### **Key Findings**
1. **Text-to-SQL workbenches**: Spider, WikiSQL, KaggleDBQA.
2. **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** help bridge business context gaps and reduce hallucinations, thereby enhancing LLM accuracy.
3. **GPT-4 Benchmark**:
   - Without KG: 16.7% accuracy.
   - With KG: **54.2% accuracy** (3x improvement).
   - Settings: `max_tokens=2048`, `n=1`, `temp=0.3`, `timeout=60s`.
   - Insight: Combining KGs with NLP/RAGs substantially boosts performance.

# 3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs for Customer Service Question Answering**

---

- **Dataset Used**: Customer Service queries related to ticketing services.  
  - KG Types:
    - **Intra-issue Tree**
    - **Inter-issue Graph**  
- **Embeddings**: Generated for nodes using models like **BERT** and **E5**, stored in a **vector database** (e.g., Qdrant).

---

### **Key Findings**
1. KGs improve retrieval accuracy and mitigate the loss of structural information caused by text segmentation.
2. The method **outperforms baseline** by:
   - **77.6%** in **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank).
   - **+0.32** in **BLEU score**.
3. KGs preserve the intrinsic relationships among issues, enhancing retrieval and answer quality.
4. **Real-world Deployment** at LinkedIn:
   - **28.6% reduction** in median issue resolution time.

---

### **Future Scope**
- **Automated Graph Template Extraction**: Eliminate manual template design.
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Real-time updates based on user queries.

---

### **Limitations**
1. **Template Dependency**: Manual maintenance required for KG templates.
2. **Static Graph**: KG isn't updated dynamically unless explicitly refreshed.
